            </p>
            <p>
                If there are sufficient legal grounds (e.g. when it is necessary for concluding or executing the
                agreement
                with you and when the information about this transfer was properly provided for you), the data can be
                transferred to our business partners or agents.

            </p>
            <p>
                We would like remind that the level of personal data protection outside the EEA countries can be lower

                upon
                the SMS or email message received), the Company will consider that you are not the subject of the

                properly, you will also receive the reply from the Company by electronic means with the exception of the
                cases when this is impossible (e.g. due to a substantial volume of information, other actual

                and reasons), or if you request to reply in different ways.
            </p>
